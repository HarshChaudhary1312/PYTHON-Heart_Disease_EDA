## Overview

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Heart Disease dataset. The project aims to explore the dataset, gain insights, and visualize various aspects related to heart disease using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset, which contains various features related to heart health and whether an individual has heart disease or not. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:

- NumPy: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process.
- `heart_Data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers if any.
3. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and distribution of variables.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations such as distribution plots for numerical columns, pie charts for categorical columns, violin plots for multiple column analysis, and correlation analysis using heatmaps, joint plots, and pair plots.

## How to Use

To run the EDA notebook:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn
3. Open `Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and explore the dataset.
